# Learning Golang
When learning a new programming language, I try to first learn basic syntax.  Then I explore what is *special* about this language.  In the case of Golang, concurrency seems to be quite special.  Then I learn how to write tests in this new language. I’ve found that figuring out how to test in the new language as early as possible will save tons of time rather than trying to learn it on a big project.

For the first lessons, I used [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) and [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

For Concurrency, I used [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvgVSSpwND8)

## 1. Write a “Hello World” program.
The first thing I do when I learn any new language is write a simple print-to-screen program: “Hello World”

## 2. Learn Variables
Golang has several ways of declaring and initializing variables

## 3. Learn Constants
A constant is a type of variable that cannont be changed. Numeric constants don’t have types until it is given one by explicit converstion... They are “untyped” 

## 4. Loops
There are 3 types of loops in go: single condition, classic initial/condition/after, and one without any condition - it keeps going until there is a `break`.  Loops also have a keyword: `condition` that is used to skip to the next iteration.


## 5. If/Else

## 6. Switch Statements

## 7. Arrays

## 8. Slice
A slice, though very similar to an array, is much more common because if its flexibility. It is dynamically sized.

## 9. Maps
Similar to hash or javascript object, a map maps keys to values.

## 10. Range
Ranges are used with for loops. They iterate over a variety of data structures: array, a pointer to an array, slice, string, map, and channels

## 11. Functions

## 12. Goroutines
Goroutines are lightweight threads.

## 13. Channels
Channels connect goroutines

## 14. Testing
